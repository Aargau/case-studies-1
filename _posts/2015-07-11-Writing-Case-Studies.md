This document provides an overview of the case study process and provides details
about writing, reviewing, and publlishing case studies.  Any TED engineer who
wants to write or review case studies will want to read this document to get
started.

## Introduction
Writing case studies is one of the ways that we share what we've learned and
leverage our work.  Publshing case studies enables us to take the work that we
 do with one partner and share it with millions, extending our reach and impact.

 PCT Case studies describe an interesting customer problem that we have solved
 with code.  Most case studies are 3-5 pages long, include code snippets, and
 reference blog posts and other case studies for deeper dives into specific
 topics.

## Process Overview
PCT has a multi-step review process to ensure that our content is accurate,
actionable, well-written, and represents our best advice.  Our process is
changing for FY16 and includes the following steps:

1. Pre-review
2. Authoring
3. Peer review
4. LT review
5. LCA/Product team/Customer approval
6. Publishing

The following sections describe each step of the process in detail.

//todo:  add details about github structure.

## Pre-review
We are adding a pre-review step to help the author make sure that his/her idea
for the whitepaper is on target.  For this review, the author writes a short
abstract (less than 10 mins), and solicits review from <TBD>.  Based on the
feedback from <TBD>, the author will move into the Authoring phase.

## Authoring
Write the content in MD, using your favorite MD editor.

## Peer Review
When you have finished a draft of your case study that you feel is ready for
peer review, add it to the GitHub case study repo by doing <x>.  Each case study
should have its own directory.  When you do the pull request to add your case study
directory to the case study repo, be sure to @mention (at least) two reviewers: (1) a domain expert in the topic you cover, and (2) an engineer who is not
familiar with the topic.

After you have received and integrated their feedback, your pull request will be
merged into the master case study repo.
